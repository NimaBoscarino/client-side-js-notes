W3D2 Breakout - jQuery
====================

1. Why does it exist?
    1. "Adds" a bunch of functionality, specifically with handling the DOM
    2. As the years go on, the browsers implement all that functionality. Good stuff!
    3. Syntactical Sugar üç¨
2. How much additional behavior does it add to the browser?
    1. "Adds" DOM manipulation and event handling stuff, plus AJAX
3. Library or framework? Why?
    1. It's a library for now (for me! for demo!), but you can really buy into the ecosystem.
4. What is $ or jQuery in code exactly? How does it work?
    1. $ ======= jQuery, it's just a shortcut
5. jQuery vs jQueryUI
    1. jQueryUI gives us visual elements, and more interactions BUILT ON TOP OF jquery
6. Why is it important to learn / use jQuery ?
    1. It's still very common in a lot of workplaces
    2. Generally a very prevalent library, check libscore!
7. Event handling with jQuery
    1. `$('h1').click(function(event) { /* stuff with the event */})`
    2. Generally nicer looking than with the DOM API
8. Element creation with jQuery
    1. `$container.append('<article class="pet">Bongo</article>');`
9. Alternatives?
    1. There are alternatives! First, there's the DOM API. There's also 3rd Party solutions! (Zepto, jqLite, etc...)
